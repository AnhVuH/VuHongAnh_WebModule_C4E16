Q: Are there any duplicate ids in the records?
If yes, put screenshots of the records which are so in your answer
If no, why? Guess what information this is field represents and its implication/application


A: No. Because in MongoDB, each document stored in a collection requires an unique _id field that acts as a primary key.
If an inserted document omits the _id field, the MongoDB driver automatically generates an ObjectId for the _id field.

  An ObjectId is unique because ObjectId value consist of 12 bytes,
  where the first four bytes are a timestamp that reflect the ObjectId’s creation.
  Specifically:
    a 4-byte value representing the seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970 00:00 UTC)
    a 3-byte machine identifier,
    a 2-byte process id,
    a 3-byte counter, starting with a random value.
  In summary, the _id's first nine bytes guarantee its uniqueness across machines and processes, in relation to a single second;
  the last three bytes provide uniqueness within a single second in a single process.

Applications of _id field is organization and handling of documents.
Default ObjectIds with first four bytes are a timestamp that reflect the ObjectId’s creation, we can access the creation of their timestamps for seeing precisely when a document was created and sort documents with a rough adherence to when they were created.
Additionally, because the _id field is unique, we can find exactly a document in collection by id
